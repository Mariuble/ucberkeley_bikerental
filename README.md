# Run the model
There are two main methods to run the code:  

(1) You can either go through the notebooks and run through each model.  

(2) You can run the ./train_and_test.sh script in the /scripts directory.

For the second method:
1. Make sure you have the required packages installed. I have created requirements.txt file which you can build your virtual environment on.
2. `cd` into the script directory from your terminal.
3. Run `./train_and_test.sh`.
4. Look at the printed R-squared value to evaluate model.
